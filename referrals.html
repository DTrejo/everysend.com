<p>You want your friend to work with you. You want your referral bonus. You<br>want your friend to make money. How do you do everything you possibly can<br>to get your friend hired? Read on :)</p>
<p>Here are all the ways that my friend hustled to get me hired as his<br>referral, as well as the ways I hustle to get my referrals through the<br>hiring process. Pick and choose which techniques you want to use. I‚Äôve<br>marked the most important ones with a star üí´.</p>
<h2 id="ways-to-help-your-referral-from-start-to-finish">Ways to help your referral from start to finish</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ask them what they are looking for so you can route them towards work<br>they actually want to do</li>
<li>Have a 15-60 minute conversation with them where you answer all their<br>tough, deep questions and also share the answers to all the tough questions<br>you want to know while evaluating a company. Give them all the insider<br>information they need to decide they want to work at your company.</li>
<li>üí´ Look for positions in your company which match what they want, and<br>introduce your friend to the hiring managers for those positions</li>
<li>This is also a good time to put your referral into Lever or your official<br>referral system so you can get credit</li>
<li>How to find the hiring managers? 1) ask people on the relevant teams<br>about who the hiring managers are 2) face to face, ask a recruiter friend<br>who the hiring managers are</li>
<li>What if you don‚Äôt see any open positions for what your friend wants to<br>do? Don‚Äôt give up. Find and introduce your friend to the hiring managers<br>anyway, because everyone is always hiring, or they may not have published<br>the job descriptions yet, or the headcount might be opening up next week.</li>
<li>How do you introduce your friend to the hiring manager? Ask the hiring<br>manager if they want an intro; if you can‚Äôt find them in person, send an<br>email like this:<br>Subject: Want intro? Growth Engineer Candidate<br>Hey $firstname, want an intro to $friendname who wants to do growth<br>engineering for us? Just reply yes or no, and it‚Äôs okay to say no.<br>$optionalLinksToLinkedInOrGithubOrWhatever<br>$optionalResume<br>Thanks in advance,<br>$yourname</li>
<li>When the hiring manager says yes, introduce them:<br>Subject: $friendname &lt;&gt; $hiringmanagername re Growth Engineering @ Credit<br>Karma<br>$friendname meet $hiringmanager name. $ hiringmanagername meet $friendname.</li>
</ul>
<p>$friendname wants to do growth engineering with us. They are impressive in<br>these ways. $optionalLinksToLinkedInOrGithubOrWhatever</p>
<p>$hiringmanager name is in charge of $listOfAreas. They are impressive in<br>these ways. $linkToLinkedIn</p>
<p>You would both benefit from speaking.<br>$yourName</p>
<ul>
<li>Now follow up every two days and cc both of them and ask what is going<br>on.</li>
<li>If the recruiter is involved, whenever you ping them, ask ‚Äúhey $person,<br>any updates?‚Äù, and send the email to everyone, with the main person you<br>want movement from in the TO field, and use their name. Everyone else gets<br>Cc‚Äôd.</li>
<li>You might be a thinking, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs fucking annoying! I don‚Äôt want to spam<br>people like that!‚Äù You‚Äôre thinking about this all wrong. If your company<br>makes the hire, that means your friend will make the company 3x to 10x to<br>20x to 100x what they are paid. You are doing the company a big favor by<br>referring your friend, and this is why you get a referral bonus. You are<br>also doing your friend a favor because hopefully your company actually pays<br>people. If not, leave ASAP. The hiring manager should and WILL thank you<br>for following up and keeping everyone updated and on task.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that the process is thoroughly kicked off, keep pushing it along and<br>updating your referral on what you learn. When they progress to each<br>consecutive round, give them whatever tips you might have, or consider<br>talking to someone on their future team and ask about what they are looking<br>for in interviews so you can relay any tips without giving away key<br>information.</p>
<p>When your friend gets an offer, talk over their offer with them and any<br>other offers they have and actually help them decide between them. Even if<br>they have another better offer, San Francisco is small and you will<br>probably run into them and you want to give them good advice.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-tell-your-referral">What to tell your referral</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep them maximally updated on everything you are doing for them. If<br>you‚Äôre still searching for hiring managers, let them know you haven‚Äôt<br>forgotten about them.</li>
<li>üí´ Ask your friend to ping you if 1) you haven‚Äôt updated them in 2 days,<br>or, 2) the other people in the company haven‚Äôt gotten back to them in 2<br>days. If you really wanted to hustle and be quick, you could do 1 day. Make<br>sure your referral has your number so they can text or call you, which is<br>way easier and better than having them email you.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="for-quicker-turnaround-">For quicker turnaround...</h2>
<ul>
<li>üí´ Always always always, even if you feel it may be a bit inconsiderate,<br>visit the desk of the recruiter or hiring manager to talk with them. You<br>will get better, faster, more thorough answers to your questions. And they<br>will thank you for it, because this is how they operate (unlike us<br>engineers, they don‚Äôt mind interruptions).</li>
</ul>
<p>That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got for you‚Äîgo forth, get your referrals hired, and go for<br>expensive dinners with your new referral cash!</p>
